# lein-show-updates

A Leiningen plugin to show available dependencies updates of the current project.

The plugin is a poor man's [lein-outdated](https://github.com/ato/lein-outdated).

## Usage

Until a version is released, run `git clone` and then `lein install` to build 
the plugin locally.

Put `[lein-show-updates "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile.

Should you need to have the plugin available for any project, add the following
to the `~/.lein/profiles.clj`

	{:user {:plugins [[lein-show-updates "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]}}

Either way should let you run the plugin as follows:

    $ lein show-updates
